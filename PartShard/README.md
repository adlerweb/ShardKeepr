# ShardKeepr

ShardKeepr is an inventory management software, primarily designed for electronic components.

ShardKeepr is written in PHP and using the Symfony5 framework.

It is based on PartKeepr, which is/was abandoned and no longer suitable for current versions of PHP. This system should reimplement most features in Symfony5 while mostly keeping database compatibility.

This is currently only a incomplete playgound allowing you to edit a few things using a Bootstrap/Datatable interface. Do **NOT** throw it against you production database.
